<!-- STEP TWO: CUSTOMIZE THE LOOK-->
<!-- Make adjustments to the display size, text color, background color, border, text alignment, etc... -->
<!-- Use 4 different types of bootstrap classes -->
<!-- The best way to do this is to search using the navbar. Put in a term OR a class tag -->
<!-- A few pages that should be helpful to start out with.... 
  Use https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/content/typography/ to adjust the display (size, etc)
  Use https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/customize/color/ to adjust color attributes 
  (there's also different pages with background color, opacity, etc )-->

          Drawing intervention may be beneficial to improve mental health in elementary school children, in the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic. Further work incorporating larger sample sizes, longitudinal data and ensuring sufficient statistical power is warranted to evaluate the long-term impact of both interventions on childrenâ€™s mental health.

          Art therapy involving a professional art therapist or artist and active art-making of the patients can possibly have a positive effect on anxiety, depression, and QoL in adults with cancer. However, further research with stringent definitions of art therapy as an intervention and appropriate randomized designs are urgently needed. For as long as people have faced problems or detrimental situations, there has been a need for art therapy.

          men may be less likely to admit when they feel vulnerable, whether to themselves, friends, or a GP. They also can be more reticent than women to see a doctor. Here we can see that statistically, men are more affected by mental health issues and are more likely to kill themselves compared to women.
