<td>People experience so many changes in their body at once it’s difficult to have time to process what is happening. Art therapy is an eternal expression for how someone is internally feeling. It’s a combination of psychological therapy with artistic activities that allow the patient to non verbally express themselves (Bazargan & Pakdaman, 2016)
</td>
<td>In a world filled with life changing constantly, one's mind and body can’t always keep up. Art therapy is a gateway to catching yourself mentally and physically to your current situation through non-verbal expression. </td>
<td>Informs potential solutions through first identifying a group of people to focus upon and stating why. With statistics and facts about teens or other people that have faced early adolescence scientists have focused their energy in providing different forms of therapy and have come to the conclusion that the standard verbal therapy won’t suffice. Enter art therapy! Allowing people to communicate their emotions and their past experiences through a physical representation of it.

<th scope="row">Without proper tools to feel confident and break through internet’s restraints, individuals won't be able to heal.</th>
<td>The more control an adolescent has over their life; the more likely they will live their life with more confidence in who they are. Potash (2009) found that art therapy can be more beneficial for individuals, rather than a group setting, but it really all depends on the person's needs for individual attention. Creating art allows individuals to connect their life experiences together, and also allows a pathway to connect with other individuals. 
</td>
<td>Art therapy has been one of the many therapy forms to be chosen to be done individually. Though with later confidence, art therapy can be a form of communication for those meaning to build connections with others by showing, not telling. 
</td>
<td>When in the process of healing or gaining confidence, art therapy can allow for a sense of communication of past stories in order to fully give understanding to yourself and others. While breaking through pop-culture judgment, people can find freedom and belonging within an accepting community that encourages creativity and a healthy psychology.</td>

      <td>The media puts a lot of different pressures on adolescents to act and look a certain way if they want to be accepted or seen as attractive. Although art therapy doesn't focus on the quality of the art product the client produces, pop culture does, and focuses less attention on the story behind the art. In this kind of setting, adolescents have the control to change the pop cultures they see into how they want the person to look. By allowing clients to have power over what they desire to see in the pop culture, it opens doors for them to acknowledge they don't have to follow society's rules, and are free to be themselves.</td>
      <td>Pop culture is heavily stemmed in a teens day to day life. Constantly being judged upon if something fits the “vibe” of our generation can be exhausting; though with art therapy teens can express themselves while reconstructing society rules in order to see circumstances in a different point of view.  </td>
