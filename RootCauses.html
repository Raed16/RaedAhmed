<td>People experience so many changes in their body at once it’s difficult to have time to process what is happening. Art therapy is an eternal expression for how someone is internally feeling. It’s a combination of psychological therapy with artistic activities that allow the patient to non verbally express themselves (Bazargan & Pakdaman, 2016)
</td>
<td>In a world filled with life changing constantly, one's mind and body can’t always keep up. Art therapy is a gateway to catching yourself mentally and physically to your current situation through non-verbal expression. </td>
<td>Informs potential solutions through first identifying a group of people to focus upon and stating why. With statistics and facts about teens or other people that have faced early adolescence scientists have focused their energy in providing different forms of therapy and have come to the conclusion that the standard verbal therapy won’t suffice. Enter art therapy! Allowing people to communicate their emotions and their past experiences through a physical representation of it.

<td>"mGFFs(manufactured gluten-free foods) are recognized to be GFF and they are consideredto be economic burden" - Mahir Turhan, British university of Nicosia</td>
<td>Stores view stocking gluten-free items as an "economic burder" leading to overpricing them, or not stocking them entirely. This creates an environemt where those living a gluten-free lifestyle have to pay more than ordinary people. To call the only food people living gluten-free lifestyles volountarily and those with celiac disease an economic burden is unacceptable in our day and age.</td>
<td>There are obvious solutions to this problem. One solution is lowering prices of gluten free foods to relatively match the price of their gluten counterparts. Another solution is to make more gluten free food so the price would go down entirely worldwide. With more gluten-free foods availible to stores, the prices of each food would go down alowing stores to in turn price them lower to help prevent overpriciing.</td>

      <td>"The extra cost for consuming mGFFs comprises a considerable part of the lowest income (5.4 - 13.3%) which is a heavy economic burden for the population making the livingwith the lowest income. Consuming mGFFs for low-incomersis almost beyond imagination." - Mahir Turhan, British university of Nicosia</td>
      <td>This is directly addressing the problem high prices of gluten-free foods causes. Those with low incomes struggle with living a gluten free lifestyle. Additionaly, those with low incomes who also have celiac disease face serious medical problems if they re unable to attain suuitable foods with their income. </td>
      <td>Another sultion to this problem is to budget more to accomodate for gluten free foods. With a larger budget provided by the government, stores wouldnt see stocking gluten-free foods as a loss. They would be more willing to stock a larger variety of gluten-free foods and they would acommadate a larger population of gluten-free people leading to increased sales. </td>
